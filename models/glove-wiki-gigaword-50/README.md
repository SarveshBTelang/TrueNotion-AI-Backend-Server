### Frontend Deployment Solution for Open Source Projects
- ### Sarvesh Telang

Note:
This project can be implemented and extended with any advanced vector embedding model. However, free frontend deployment platforms such as Render, Fly.io, Railway, Koyeb, and others typically impose strict resource limits — usually around 512 MB RAM and 1 GB storage.

These constraints necessitate completely isolating the app from outbound HTTP calls, which makes running large transformer models with high parameter counts impractical unless you chose paid services or rely on serverless APIs.

Proposed Approach:
To address this, you can use a lightweight embedding model that balances moderate accuracy with efficient similarity search.

For fully offline vector embedding generation, download the pre-trained GloVe embeddings file:

glove.6B.50d.txt
Available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt (Author: Ashish Lal)

Convert the GloVe file into the Word2Vec format using the glove2word2vec tool. Then, load it with the KeyedVectors library for seamless integration into your project.

You can explore a lot more and accurate vector embedding models with txt files, however looking at the currently available sources (May 2025) this model turns out to be having the lowest size.
