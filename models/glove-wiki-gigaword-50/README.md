For fully offline vector embedding generation, download the pre-trained GloVe embeddings file:

glove.6B.50d.txt
Available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt (Author: Ashish Lal)

Convert the GloVe file into the Word2Vec format using the glove2word2vec tool. Then, load it with the KeyedVectors library for seamless integration into your project.

You can explore a lot more and accurate vector embedding models with txt files, however looking at the currently available sources (May 2025) this model turns out to be having the lowest size.
