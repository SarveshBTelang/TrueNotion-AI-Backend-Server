# Note:
# You may optionally store your constant or permanent context files in the "data" folder,
# using the JSON format shown in sample_data_example.json (remove .txt to allow files to detect, "id" could be random).
# 
#
# IMP: These files should not be exposed when committing to GitHub â€” add them to .gitignore if necessary.
#
# You can run the script once locally to upload them to Upstash Redis.
# After a successful upload, delete the local files and manage them directly through Upstash.
